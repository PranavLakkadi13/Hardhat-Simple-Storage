# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.


The sample contract is a simple contract to store variables and retreive them .
This contract also has a folder called tasks that is used to create custom hardhat tasks like ex- yarn hardhat test, yarn hardhat deploy 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
